<!-- 
Don't let this throw you. It just iterates through all the flash keys and values, and uses the content_tag helper to generate a styled paragraph for each message. That way, whatever you put in the flash will get displayed with a little style. Notice that by using an iterator we don't need a conditional because the iterator only runs for the keys that are in the flash.

content_tag(:p, "Hello world!")
 # => <p>Hello world!</p>

content_tag(:div, content_tag(:p, "Hello world!"), class: "strong")
 # => <div class="strong"><p>Hello world!</p></div>
